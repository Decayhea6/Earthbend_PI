# Earthbend_PI
A Short script that enables the player to shoot any type of block.

# Why? 
This code is ment to be an example of how to use the pollBlockHits() function in the python api. It is also very flexible and is fun to play around with.

# How?
To run it, just open the earthbending_add_on_WIP.py file in any python 3 idle, open a minecraft pi, or minecraft python spigot plugin world, and run the code.

Note(1): this has only been tested on the mincraft pi, not the spigot plugin for minecraft pc.

Note(2) This is still work in progress. Blocks with gravity do not work so well.
